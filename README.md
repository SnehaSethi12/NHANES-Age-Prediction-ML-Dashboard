# NHANES-Age-Prediction-ML-Dashboard

Hey everyone! I have created a dashboard in Streamlit that uses machine learning to predict the age of patients based on their health biomarkers - which I have been experimenting on as part of a class project.

Description

In other words, I have the NHANES 2013-2014 dataset, which I am using to train various models that would be able to predict the age of a person based on such factors as BMI, glucose, and other markers of health. The application can be divided into three primary screens: data analysis, which contains 7 various regression models, age-group classification, and real-time age prediction interface of new patient data.

Features

- Compare regression models 7 (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN):
- Use 4 different classifiers to categorize patients as Adult (18-59) or Senior (60+)?
- Plotly-based interactive dashboard.
- Live prediction form, where you are able to input the stats of a new patient, and receive an age estimate immediately.
